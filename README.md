This is a project I'm using to consolidate learning on python and flask.

Features to build:
1. A actual book.
2. More than one actual book.
3. User accounts and saving progress.

Very basic guide to get beginners started on windows (Ellie you might want to get Daddy to do this):
1. Download and install Python https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Download and install VS Code https://code.visualstudio.com/download
3. (Optional) Download and install Git https://git-scm.com/downloads
4. Download this project somewhere on your PC, or clone it down using Git.
5. Open VS Code and in the terminal type: pip install flask
6. Open folder containing this project on your PC. 
7. Select the main.py file and click run.
8. Visit http://127.0.0.1:5000 in any browser.
